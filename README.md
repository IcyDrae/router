# Router

This is a basic routing package, used as a learning project
in object-oriented PHP and HTTP.

## Structure

#### Namespace

```php
Gjoni\Router
```

The user interacts with the Router class which validates and passes the input to a dispatcher.






(Mapper accepts a controllers namespace: App\Controllers is the default namespace)
